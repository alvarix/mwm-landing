                    "Wanllan Mi Wanlle"  (WMW) means "Help Me, I Help You" in Fulani.<br>
                    The group focuses on helping its members navigate the treacherous waters of our current immigration laws as well as to promote community to overcome isolation and loneliness. All hands are welcome. A large community of allies among native New Yorkers and beyond provide support by donating time, money and wisdom to widen WMW’s impact and sustainability. WMW also benefits from the generous advice from staff at Co-Counsel, NYC and many other organizational partners.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    WMW’s support takes many forms, as members and volunteers share their time and expertise. Assistance can take the form of guiding access to public benefits, encompassing Medicaid, food stamps, the NYC ID card, reduced Metro-card fare, and many forms of English language programs. Our volunteers are called “Navigators” and can help members with many of the services listed below, for free, as well as just being friendly listeners and mentors.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The greatest focus in this moment is on the complex asylum process, including reporting to ICE, scheduling remote hearings, and finding accurate legal advice, in general. Members also get help with civil and criminal legal matters and unfair medical bills. Housing and work are also important topics, including employment authorization applications, small business assistance and trading information on apartment shares. Members also join regular soccer games in Prospect Park and monthly collective dinners at the offices.
